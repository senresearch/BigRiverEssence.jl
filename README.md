## Description

BigRiverEssence implements different methods for capturing the essential structure 
of high-dimensional data matrices. It provides a broad range of methods, from standard 
techniques to specialized algorithms for sparse, supervised, and integrative analyses.

> **Why “Essence”?** The name reflects the package’s goal of reducing
> large, high-dimensional data matrices to their essential structure
> through matrix decomposition and dimension reduction.  It is a
> component of the BigRiver Julia package ecosystem.

These methods can be used to extract low-dimensional structure, identify sparse latent components, 
and characterize shared and dataset-specific variation across multiple data sources. The package 
is designed for high-dimensional data, particularly high-throughput biological and omics 
data.

The core routines prioritize computational efficiency in mind, with an emphasis on 
reducing memory usage. They rely primarily on optimized matrix 
operations to support fast exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, supervised dimension 
reduction, and integrative analysis of complex datasets.

The package currently implements the following methods:

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)[^1]
* Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA)[^2]
* Penalized Matrix Decomposition (PMD)[^2]
* Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)[^3][^4]
* Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)[^5]
* Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA)[^6]
* Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE)[^7]
* Partial Least Squares Kernel Regression (PLSkern)[^8]
* Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA)[^9]
* Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (SPLSDA)[^10][^11]
